Duck-typing uses the "duck test": "When i see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, i call that bird a duck." Applied to types in a programming language, the duck test suggests that as long as an object exhibits the behaviour of a certain interface, it should be treated as that interface. Unfortunately, this is not true by default in C#.
